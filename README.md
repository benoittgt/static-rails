# static-rails

A gem to support integrating one or more static sites with your Rails
application.

## Install

Add this to your Gemfile:

```
gem "static-rails"
```

And run this to generate an initializer in which to configure your static sites:

```
$ rails g static_rails:initializer
```


## Configuring your static site generator

### Using Gatsby

If you're mounting a Gatsby site to a non-root path (e.g. in static-rails,
you've configured its `url_root_path` to,
say, `careers`), then you'll want to configure the same root path in Gatsby as
well, so that its development servers and built assets line up correctly.

To do this, first add the `pathPrefix` property to `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  pathPrefix: `/careers`,
  // â€¦
}
```

Next, add the flag `--prefix-paths` to both the Gatsby site's `server_command`
and `compile_command`, or else the setting will be ignored.

### Using Jekyll

If you have a Jekyll app that you plan on serving from a non-root path (say,
`/docs`), then you'll need to set the `baseurl` in `_config.yml`:

```yml
baseurl: "/docs"
```

(Note that this means running the Jekyll application directly using `bundle exec
jekyll serve` will also start serving at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/docs/`)

### Using Hugo

The most important thing is setting `baseURL` in your root `config.toml` file:

```toml
baseURL = "http://blog.example.com/"
```

Hugo can be a little tricky, because by the `.Permalink` value will always
include a fully qualified protocol, host, and port, even when running its `hugo
server` command.  That means if you're forwarding `http://blog.localhost:3000`
to a Hugo server running on `http://localhost:1313`, it's very likely the static
files (e.g. all the links on the page) will have references to
`http://localhost:1313`, which may result in accidentally navigating away from
your Rails development server unexpectedly.

One way to mitigate this is to favor `.RelPermalink` in your templates over
`.Permalink` where possible.
